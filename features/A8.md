This page details currently supported features on all A8 series (A8, A8X) devices, as well as their progress towards being upstreamed.
The tables herein can be interpreted as follows:

Kernel release, e.g. 6.13: the feature was incorporated upstream as of this release

linux-apple (kernel release): the feature is stable, available for use in linux-apple `apple` branch, and should be upstream by the release indicated.

linux-apple: the feature is (mostly) stable and available for use in linux-apple `apple` branch

WIP: Development work on the feature is actively progressing, however is not yet ready for wider testing, use or distribution

TBA: Active work on this feature is not being undertaken at this time

-: This feature is not available on the hardware

HomePod is currently unsupported due to lack of testing.
