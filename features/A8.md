# A8 Series Feature support

This page details currently supported features on all A8 series (A8, A8X) devices, as well as their progress towards being upstreamed.
The tables herein can be interpreted as follows:

Kernel release, e.g. 6.13: the feature was incorporated upstream as of this release

linux-apple (kernel release): the feature is stable, available for use in linux-apple `apple` branch, and should be upstream by the release indicated.

linux-apple: the feature is (mostly) stable and available for use in linux-apple `apple` branch

WIP: Development work on the feature is actively progressing, however is not yet ready for wider testing, use or distribution

TBA: Active work on this feature is not being undertaken at this time

-: This feature is not available on the hardware

HomePod is currently unsupported due to lack of testing.
